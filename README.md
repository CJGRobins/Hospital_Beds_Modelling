# Hospital_Beds_Modelling
Time Series and LSTM modelling of hospital bed capacity

RUN 'RUN ME FIRST'
this translates the databases into a usable format in R
You could copy and paste the relevant parts into the start of each model code, but if you keep it in one R project it will be faster
Each of the models produces a certain output
You can change the forecast range by changing the 'h' parameter under the mutate() forecast function (remember the 6h forecasts are ndays*4)

Models wil be outputted in the data frames ending with _tidy
Any questions just email me @ cjgr1g15@soton.ac.uk


LSTM model capacity coming - machine learning is hard
